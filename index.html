                Consistent willingness to learn has always helped me in my studies and projects to quickly find my way into new topics and processes. New tasks and challenges inspire me. I not only like to learn but also quickly and persistently. They are essential prerequisites for achieving goals. I quickly familiarize myself with my areas of responsibility and can therefore take on work and make difficult decisions within a very short time.
